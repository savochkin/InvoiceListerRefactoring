* Real class is here: src/main/java/com/booking/faas/fintooling/service/repo/fin/FinanceInvoiceBrazilService.java
* Code smell: "Middle Man" bad smell. (see https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/ch03.xhtml#:-:text=Middle%20Man)
* not sure what value they are adding...but they increase the code base and its complexity
* if we are following the DDD - suggestion is to use Entities, VO, Repositories as first class citizens
* services should be used to implement some important domain logic only if the logic does not fit
* into any entity/VO/Repository
* Suggestion: remove all such services and use repositories directly instead
